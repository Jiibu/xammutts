# Connectivity-Plugin-Sample
Full sample for xam.plugins.connectivity from https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/Xamarin.Plugins/tree/master/Connectivity .
Samples for iOS, Android, and UWP for all APIs known.
Why - Existing sample didn't show all functionality.  Also makes for cool demo.
Why not - wp81 or windows81.  Me - really dont care about them anymore.  My big three are UWP, Android, and iOS.
